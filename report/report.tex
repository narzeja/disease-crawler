\begin{abstract}
In this paper we design and construct models for assisting physicians
with the task of diagnosing rare diseases. Using a prior knowledge of
rare diseases consisting of \textit{disease name, some symptoms} and
\textit{synonyms}, we utilize the \textit{Google Search Engine} to build
the model over several iterations. The model is constructed using
machine learning and natural language processing techniques by text
mining symptoms and features from abstracts and other interesting
paragraphs of text found in the search process.

\section{Introduction}
\label{chap:introduction}
Physicians have expressed a need for aiding in the process of diagnosing
rare diseases \cite{googlingdiagnosis}, and point towards using the
Internet as a resource for information gathering, with particular focus
on utilizing Google or other search engines \cite{googlechangemedicine}
\cite{diagnosissearchengines}.

The current process of automating this process relies heavily on static
information, which is only expanded through manual interaction. \fxwarning{citation needed}
\url{http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/},
\url{http://www.rarediseases.org/}, \url{http://www.orpha.net/}.

In this project, we investigate methods for automating information
collection of specific features from rare diseases, with focus on
establishing a model of which a practising physician may query a case
report for some patient and get a prediction of possible diseases based
on the knowledge of the model.
To increase the precision of the prediction, we must expand the model
and look into harvesting specific information of some disease through a
number of iterations on popular search engines. We use Natural Language
Processing and Machine Learning techniques to extract unique information
from some description of the disease, by assuming certain semantic and
syntactic properties of symptoms and medically related phrases and
terms.

In the following we will present and highlight current and previous work
within this domain. In chapter 3, we will discuss our method
methodically, with particular focus on construction of model and feature
extraction and post processing of harvested information.
Then we will explain how we tested the system and argue statistical
significances by comparing to previous work, as well as assessing the
viability of our system as it is.
Finally we will conclude our paper and discuss implications and other
thoughts relevant to our method, while also proposing a number of topics
for future work.

\subsection{Limitations}
\todo[inline]{Blanks to be filled.}

\section{Previous Work}
Current work by Radu Dragusin and Paula something investigate the same
thesis of automating information gathering as those we are presenting.
However, as this is a work in progress we do not have access to further
information at this point in time \cite{radupaula}.

\cite{jensenandersen} proposed a system for diagnosing rare diseases
using vector space models and text mining. They showed a clear potential
in automating such a process, but their results were not statistically
significant. Their system did not rely on prior knowledge of particular
diseases, but still showed that around 60\% of the tests were
satisfactory.


The article \cite{googlingdiagnosis} proves the viability of using
Google as a diagnosis aid, despite the tests being done manually with
little consideration with regard to automation or test reliability and
validity.

%Our system will move on to the next step and introduce intelligent
%automation through a number of predefined criteria and utilizing several
%machine learning and natural language processing techniques.


The editorials \cite{googlechangemedicine} and
\cite{diagnosissearchengines} suggest Google and search engines in
general as being a very strong player in the taskTo perform the initial
testing we mimicked the previous project where a TF-IDF matrix was build
using information (abstracts,titles, keywords) gathered form Pubmed. The
knowledge of search engines being a valuable source of information is
apparent, but the shear amount of misinformation and noise from regular
searches make such a method in it’s current incarnation unreliable and
error prone.\fxwarning{citation needed} \todo[inline]{Omformuler,
præciser!}
%(Our goal is to refine and provide means for filtering out this noise
%and focus on harvesting information from related material with reference
%to the original search terms as well as specific criteria for the text
%mining process.)


%Inspiration for a system: Online Search Engine specialised for
%diagnosing stuff etc.
%http://www.healthline.com/symptomsearch

%This system is based on simple searches that relies on an already
%established database of diseases with appropriate meta-information. The
%user is able to search for symptoms and can narrow down the search by
%adding several symptoms. The system will then present a list of possible
%diseases according to some relevance criterion.

%(It is an end-user focused system, while our system will be a back-bone
%focused system, attempting to establish a model on which queries may be
%imposed. It will as such automate the information collection based on
%several machine learning and natural language processing techniques
%appropriate for the needs.)

\section{Method}
As one of the premises of the project was to introduce prior knowledge
of the disease model, we needed to process our available data. We were
given a large corpus of data from Orphanet \ref{app:orphanet},
consisting of \texttt{\{orphanum, disease name, disease
description/abstract, maybe author and date\}} for each disease in the
data set.
The data is processes similar to the method described in
\cite{jensenandersen}, and will thus be used too bootstrap our knowledge
of each disease, allowing us to iterate and harvest additional
information using various harvesting techniques roughly covering the use
of the \textit{Google} search engine to collect an array of websites
given a query relevant to the disease (disease name and a possibly a
number of keywords). For each website, we will collect paragraphs and
save it for further processing if the cosine angle between the two
vectors is within a reasonable threshold. For each accepted paragraph we
use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to identify candidates
for relevant terms and phrases that will then be used to expand the
model. The abstract flow model is available in figure \ref{fig:flow}.


\begin{figure}[htp!]

\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{images/pipeline}
\caption{Some crap}

\end{center}
\end{figure}

The process will be described in greater detail in the following
sections.

\subsection{Building the preliminary model}
To perform the initial testing we mimicked the setup of
\cite{jensenandersen} where a TF-IDF matrix was build using information
(abstracts,titles, keywords) gathered form Pubmed. 

A sparse term-disease matrix (similar to the well-known term-document
model) was build over the abstracts received from Orphanet. Each row in
the matrix thus represented a the feature vector of a disease with the
features being a list of term frequencies. Prior to the creation of the
matrix, the terms were stemmed (using the Porter stemming algorithm) and
stopwords were removed along with non-alphanumerical symbols. The
term-disease matrix were then processed using the TF-IDF model (as
originally proposed by \cite{tfidf}) along with additional logarithmic
smoothing of the $tf_{t,d}$-parameter to flatten term-burstiness
(\cite{burstiness}). The TF-IDF model 
\[
w_{t,d} = log(tf_{t,d}+1)\cdot log\frac{|D|}{|{d'\in D|t\in d'}|}
\]
where $tf_{t,d}$ is term frequency of term $t$ in disease $d$, $|D|$ is
the total number of diseases in the disease set, and $|{d'\in D|t\in
d'}|$ if number of diseases containing the term $t$.



\todo[inline]{add short describtion of preliminary test cases}

\subsection{Harvesting data, or: None Like it Raw!}
Harvesting additional data to expand our existing TF-IDF model is done
using the Google search engine. For each site corresponding to our
query, disease name and a number of keywords from disease abstract, we
extract paragraphs and measure the relevance of that paragraph compared
to the corresponding abstract from Orphanet. The comparison is measured
using a covariance measure, where 0 is complete correlation and 1 is no
correlation, and accept paragraphs for further processing given a
threshold of $0.8$. This number is used based on a number of anecdotal
tests showing a reasonable amount of relevant information, where e.g.
$0.9$ would introduce too much noise, and $0.7$ being too strict.

The comparison consists of constructing a $2 x n$ matrix, for $n$ being
the number of unique terms in both texts, after which the cosine
similarity measure is calculated and accepted paragraphs pushed onto
further processing.

Something N-gram machine learning here.

\subsection{Feature Extraction}
In order to iterate and collect information to expand the modelling of
relevant terms and phrases we use NLP to identify symptoms and medical
terms (here-on referred to as just symptom) from abstracts and
paragraphs harvested. Identifying unique symptoms and correlate with
other documents describing the same disease will increase the knowledge,
or further substantiate pre-existing knowledge of that disease. The
ultimate goal of this strategy is to expand the model and highlight
unique keywords such that, given our assumption, it will increase the
precision of the prediction.

We have observed that symptoms are usually described as zero or more
adjectives or verbs followed by one or more nouns\fxwarning{substantiate this claim somehow}.
Thus we can build a regular grammar using the Python NLTK library\footnote{\url{http://nltk.org/}} as
such:
\begin{lstlisting}
grammar = """CANDIDATE: {VBD><IN>(<SYMPTOM><,|CC>)*}
             SYMPTOM: {<JJ|VB(D|G)>*<NN>+}"""
\end{lstlisting}
This will catch sentences such as \texttt{characterized by s$_{0}$,
s$_{1}$, ... and s$_{n}$}, where \texttt{s$_{i}$} is a potential symptom
candidate.
This will allow us to catch the symptom \texttt{bleeding diathesis}, but
will also match, for our purpose, insignificant medical-related terms
such as \texttt{gene product}.
The premise for the construction of this grammar is substantiated
through anecdotal manual observations of a handful of abstracts from the
orphanet data set, and utilized under the assumption that it will
increase the amount of medically relevant terms as opposed to simply
catching all combinations matching the \texttt{SYMPTOM} grammar above.
The grammar applied to the sentence \textit{``Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome
type 2 (HPS-2) is a type of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS; see this
term), a multi-system disorder characterized by oculocutaneous albinism,
bleeding diathesis and neutropenia.''}\footnote{Excerpt from the
Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome abstract from the Orphanet data set.} gives us
the following POS-tagged syntax tree:
\begin{lstlisting}
(S
  (SYMPTOM Hermansky-Pudlak/JJ syndrome/NN type/NN)
  2/CD
  (/CD
  HPS-2/-NONE-
  )/:
  is/VBZ
  a/DT
  (SYMPTOM type/NN)
  of/IN
  (SYMPTOM Hermansky-Pudlak/JJ syndrome/NN)
  (/:
  HPS/NNP
  ;/:
  see/VB
  this/DT
  (SYMPTOM term/NN)
  )/:
  ,/,
  a/DT
  (SYMPTOM multi-system/JJ disorder/NN)
  (CANDIDATE characterized/VBD by/IN)
  (SYMPTOM oculocutaneous/JJ albinism/NN)
  ,/,
  (SYMPTOM bleeding/VBG diathesis/NN)
  and/CC
  (SYMPTOM neutropenia/NN)
  ./.)
\end{lstlisting}
Submitting to the grammar we produced, we are particularly interested in
the \texttt{CANDIDATE} subtree
\begin{lstlisting}
  (CANDIDATE characterized/VBD by/IN)
  (SYMPTOM oculocutaneous/JJ albinism/NN)
  ,/,
  (SYMPTOM bleeding/VBG diathesis/NN)
  and/CC
  (SYMPTOM neutropenia/NN)
\end{lstlisting}
of which our algorithm will evaluate the phrases against harvested
symptom and medical term
databases\footnote{\url{http://www.medicinenet.com/},
\url{http://www.diseasesdatabase.com},
\url{http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/}}\footnote{Number of symptoms sum to
a total of 29856 symptoms, with possible minor overlap, example:
\textit{neck tingling} and \textit{neck tingling/paresthesias}.} and extract
\textit{oculocutaneous albinism}, \textit{bleeding diathesis},
\textit{neutropenia} as candidates.

While the grammar does not explicitly collect symptoms or medical terms
exclusively, we must figure out a way to filter out noise.

\todo[inline]{explain selecting symptoms from databases}

Having collected a number of symptom candidates $\mathbb{S}$ from some
document or paragraph, we calculate number of unique terms and return
the candidates, $\mathbb{S'}$, that appear more than once or a supterm of
other candidates. I.e., consider the candidates $\mathbb{S} = $
\texttt{\{bleeding diathesis, bleeding, sleep apnae\}} we will return
the symptoms $\mathbb{S'} = $ \texttt{\{bleeding diathesis, bleeding\}},
using the mathematical rule:
\begin{equation}
 s_{j}, s_{i} \in \mathbb{S'}\texttt{if count}(s_{j}) > 1 \wedge\texttt{count}(s_{i}) \wedge s_{j} \subset s_{i}, \texttt{for } s_{i}, s_{j} \in \mathbb{S}
\end{equation}
\todo[inline]{valider formel}
Anecdotal observations during the development phase of this module
showed that returning terms and supterms using this mathematical rule
increased the amount of relevant symptoms, and seemed to decrease the
amount of noise generated in the symptom harvesting process. We call
this the \texttt{Term \textbf{x} Supterm Relevance Score} (TSRS).

%\subsubsection{Feature Extraction using NLP}
%We will use NLP techniques to extract candidates for this
%classification, using Part-of-Speech (POS)
%tagging\todo[inline]{Brief explanation here}, and semantic
%recognition of terms and phrases.



%After considerable consideration, we have decided to limit the scope of
%our information harvesting to sites, guaranteed to be within the domain
%of disease and/or rare diseases. As such, we methodically crawl each
%known site of interest and extract phrases, paragraphs and documents
%which are suitable candidates to contain information according to the
%query of features.

%While we may potentially lose critical information by limiting our
%searches to specific sites, we also gain precision in our models by only
%harvesting information within our domain. As such, we do not risk
%running into documents that are not necessarily important for the
%purpose of our model, but still show up as a result, caused by more or
%less vague references to the given query. In order to widen the scope of
%the searches, one would have to not only define modular ways of
%extracting valuable information within any site available on the
%Internet, but also look into document classification \cite{Jimmy}, to
%decrease the level of noise. The implementation of such a classification
%model is relatively simple, and only require a substantial amount of
%corpora of documents for training and testing the model, but we did not
%see it as important in this project and will leave the discussion as is.


%For each \texttt{SearchGoogle} instance, we define which domain it
%should retrieve results from, as well as an extractor function that
%reads the results and returns information to be processed further, by
%our feature extraction algorithm. All of these results are thus passed
%into a mathematical model and used to increase disease prediction
%precision or widen the amount of known diseases. I.e. expand the model.


\section{Tests}
We have chosen to base our tests on known test cases, from in particular
those mentioned in \cite{jensenandersen}, \cite{googlingdiagnosis} and
tests listed in \ref{app:tests}. We will then consider the significance
across the results and introduce the independent variable
\texttt{method} with the values \texttt{\{manual, semiautomatic,
automatic\}}, where \texttt{manual} is the method used in
\cite{googlingdiagnosis}, \texttt{semiautomatic} is the method used in
\cite{jensenandersen} and finally \texttt{automatic} is the method
described in this paper.

The tests are compared using the dependant variable \texttt{prediction},
that describes the position of the correct disease. I.e. the best result
is 1 and worst result is $n$ where $n$ is the number of known diseases
in the TF-IDF model.

The results are described in table \ref{tab:results1} below.
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{llll}
		Case number & Manual Googling & Semi-automatic & Automatic \\ \hline
		1 &  &  &  \\
		2 &  &  &  \\
		3 &  &  &  \\
		4 &  &  &  \\
		5 &  &  &  \\
	\end{tabular}
	\label{tab:results1}
\end{center}
Note that, for the manual googling method, the results presented in
\cite{googlingdiagnosis} only considered binary results depicted as
'Yes' if they predicted the diseases and 'No' otherwise. There is no
ranking of where the correct was found from a number of possibilities,
in contrary to \cite{jensenandersen} and this project.

We have introduced a method to automate harvesting and 


\subsection{Future Work}
Symptom extraction is a complex problem that requires the system to have
a substantial knowledge and an intelligent model to determine whether a
phrase is a symptom, medical term or not. We used assumptions of
symptoms relative position in a paragraph to narrow the search, and used
voting and correlation of individual terms and subterms to determine
whether a phrase was accepted as a symptom or simply discarded, this
process is relatively weak and only relies on anecdotally supported
assumptions.

A method that may improve symptom extraction is to utilize clustering
algorithms, but will, in turn of allowing us to directly measure the
performance of the system (training and testing), require a substantial
amount of preparation by annotating a large corpus of documents for
constructing a reasonable amount of data. In this project we have only
succeeded in harvesting phrases that \textit{are} medical terms and
symptoms, but have failed to harvest or construct an equally sized data
set consisting of terms that are \textit{not} related to medicine.
