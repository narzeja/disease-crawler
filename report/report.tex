\begin{abstract}
In this paper we design and construct models for assisting physicians
with the task of diagnosing rare diseases. Using a prior knowledge of
rare diseases consisting of \textit{disease name, some symptoms} and
\textit{synonyms}, we utilize the \textit{Google Search Engine} to build
the model over several iterations. The model is constructed using
several machine learning and natural language processing techniques by
text mining symptoms and features from abstracts and other interesting
paragraphs of text found in the search process.

Our tests show that... blablabla, \fxwarning{Abstract, results: to do}

\subsection{Limitations}


\section{Previous Work}
Blabla work by radu and paula \cite{radupaula}.


\cite{jensenandersen} worked on a system for diagnosing rare diseases
using vector space models and text mining. They showed a clear potential
in automating such a process, but their results were not statistically
significant. Their system did not rely on prior knowledge of particular
diseases, but still showed that around 60\% of the tests were
satisfactory.


The article \cite{googlingdiagnosis} is the base line for our research.
It proves the viability of using Google as a diagnosis aid, despite the
tests being done manually with little thought done with regard to
automation or test reliability and validity.
%Our system will move on to the next step and introduce intelligent
%automation through a number of predefined criteria and utilizing several
%machine learning and natural language processing techniques.


The editorials \cite{googlechangemedicine} and
\cite{diagnosissearchengines} suggest Google and search engines in
general as being a very strong player in the task of diagnosing
diseases. The witness of search engines being a valuable source of
information is apparent, but the shear amount of misinformation and
noise from regular searches make such a system in it’s current
incarnation unreliable and error prone.
%(Our goal is to refine and provide means for filtering out this noise
%and focus on harvesting information from related material with reference
%to the original search terms as well as specific criteria for the text
%mining process.)


Inspiration for a system: Online Search Engine specialized for
diagnosing stuff etc.
http://www.healthline.com/symptomsearch

This system is based on simple searches that relies on an already
established database of diseases with appropriate meta-information. The
user is able to search for symptoms and can narrow down the search by
adding several symptoms. The system will then present a list of possible
diseases according to some relevance criterion.

%(It is an end-user focused system, while our system will be a back-bone
%focused system, attempting to establish a model on which queries may be
%imposed. It will as such automate the information collection based on
%several machine learning and natural language processing techniques
%appropriate for the needs.)
