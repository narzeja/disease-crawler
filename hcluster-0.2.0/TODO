Things I need to do:

1. Look into inlining functions.

2. Build complete regression test suite. (have to wait until DSL is hooked up)

3. Work on striding numpy arrays properly to handle the case where the
   base array refers to part of another array.

4. Work on more data types (float32)

5. Write functions for handling string distances
